# üß† What is Asymptotic Analysis?

Asymptotic analysis is a method used in computer science to describe the efficiency of an algorithm‚Äîespecially its time complexity or space complexity‚Äîas the input size (n) grows very large.

It helps you answer questions like:

- Will my program still be fast if I give it a million inputs?
- Is this algorithm scalable?

## üìè Types of Asymptotic Notations

There are three major notations used to describe performance:

| Notation   | Meaning     | Use Case                                      |
|------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Big-O (O)  | Worst-case  | Most common. Guarantees it won't get worse than this. |
| Omega (Œ©)  | Best-case   | Not used as much, shows the minimum time taken. |
| Theta (Œò)  | Average-case| Shows exact/typical time taken, if known.     |

## üöÄ Big-O Notation (Worst-Case)

Big-O notation gives the upper bound of the time complexity. It describes how the runtime or space grows with input size `n`.

### Examples of Big-O:

| Big-O      | Name              | Example                                   |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| O(1)       | Constant time     | Accessing an element in an array          |
| O(log n)   | Logarithmic       | Binary search                             |
| O(n)       | Linear time       | Looping through a list                    |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic      | Merge sort, Quick sort (avg)              |
| O(n¬≤)      | Quadratic time    | Nested loops                              |
| O(2‚Åø)      | Exponential time  | Recursive Fibonacci                       |
| O(n!)      | Factorial time    | Traveling Salesman problem                |

### ‚úÖ Example: Linear Search

```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in arr:
        if i == target:
            return True
    return False
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) ‚Äì because in the worst case, it may need to check all elements.

### ‚úÖ Example: Binary Search

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return True
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return False
```

**Time Complexity:** O(log n) ‚Äì because it halves the list each time.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:

- Constants and lower-order terms are ignored in Big-O.  
  E.g., O(3n + 2) becomes O(n).
- Big-O tells you about scalability, not actual runtime.
- Use it to compare algorithms and choose the best one for large datasets.
