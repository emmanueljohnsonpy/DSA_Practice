# üîó What is a Linked List?

A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements (called nodes) are stored in memory non-contiguously and are linked together using pointers.

Each node contains:
- **Data** ‚Äì The actual value.
- **Pointer (or reference)** ‚Äì A link to the next node in the sequence.

## üß± Types of Linked Lists

### 1. Singly Linked List
- Each node points to the next node only.
- The last node points to `NULL`.

```
[Data | Next] -> [Data | Next] -> [Data | NULL]
```

### 2. Doubly Linked List
- Each node has a pointer to the next and the previous node.
- Traversal is possible in both directions.

```
NULL <- [Prev | Data | Next] <-> [Prev | Data | Next] -> NULL
```

### 3. Circular Linked List
- The last node‚Äôs next pointer links back to the first node.

#### Singly Circular:
```
[Data | Next] -> ... -> [Data | Next] -+
                     ^                |
                     |----------------+
```

#### Doubly Circular:
```
[Prev | Data | Next] <-> ... <-> [Prev | Data | Next]
^                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------+
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Operations

| **Operation** | **Description**                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| Insertion     | Add a node (beginning, middle, end)      |
| Deletion      | Remove a node                           |
| Traversal     | Visit all the nodes                     |
| Searching     | Find a node with a specific value       |
| Updating      | Change the value of a node              |

## ‚úÖ Advantages
- Dynamic size (unlike arrays which are fixed).
- Efficient insertion/deletion (no shifting like in arrays).

---

## ‚ùå Disadvantages
- No direct access to elements (must traverse).
- Extra memory for pointers.
- Slower access time compared to arrays.
