## 🔍 What is Complexity Analysis?

Complexity Analysis is the process of estimating the efficiency of an algorithm or operation in terms of:

- **Time Complexity** → How long it takes to run.
- **Space Complexity** → How much memory it consumes.

We typically use **Big O Notation (O)** to express this, focusing on worst-case scenarios unless otherwise noted.

## 📊 Common Time Complexities in Big O

| Notation   | Name          | Example                          |
|------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| **O(1)**   | Constant      | Accessing an element in an array |
| **O(log n)** | Logarithmic | Binary search                   |
| **O(n)**   | Linear        | Iterating through a list         |
| **O(n log n)** | Linearithmic | Merge sort                   |
| **O(n²)**  | Quadratic     | Nested loops (like bubble sort)  |
