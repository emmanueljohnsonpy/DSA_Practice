## 💾 What is a Data Structure?

A **Data Structure** is a way to **organize and store data** so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

### Common Types of Data Structures:
- **Arrays** – Fixed-size collections (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`)
- **Linked Lists** – Elements (nodes) linked together
- **Stacks** – Last In First Out (LIFO)
- **Queues** – First In First Out (FIFO)
- **Trees** – Hierarchical data (e.g., file systems)
- **Graphs** – A set of nodes and edges (e.g., networks)
- **Hash Tables / Dictionaries** – Key-value pair mappings

## ⚙️ What is an Algorithm?

An **Algorithm** is a **step-by-step process** to solve a problem or perform a computation.

### Common Types of Algorithms:
- **Searching** (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
- **Sorting** (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- **Recursion** – Functions that call themselves
- **Dynamic Programming** – Solving subproblems and reusing results
- **Greedy Algorithms** – Choosing the best option at each step
- **Backtracking** – Trying out all possibilities and undoing steps

## 💡 Why is DSA Important?

- ✅ **Efficient Code** – Optimize performance and memory usage
- 🧠 **Problem-Solving** – Build logical thinking
- 💼 **Job Interviews** – Core part of technical interviews
- 🏗️ **Strong Foundation** – Useful in all areas of software development (AI, Web Dev, App Dev, etc.)
