# Perfect Interview Answer (Simple & Complete)

Memory allocation is the process of reserving space in a computer's memory for storing data while a program runs. It can be either static, where memory size is fixed during compile time, or dynamic, where memory is allocated at runtime based on need. In high-level languages like Python, memory allocation and deallocation are mostly handled by the interpreter automatically.

A memory leak happens when a program keeps using memory that it no longer needs and fails to release it. This can eventually slow down or crash the program. Although Python has a garbage collector and reference counting system to manage memory, memory leaks can still occur if we accidentally keep references to unused objects, preventing them from being cleaned up.
